        h1 Trentside Classic Endurance Racing

        hr

        p Hello - we are a UK based motorcycle race team called Trentside Racing. Our main focus this season has been in competing in the FIM classic endurance championship consisting of four rounds in France (Paul Ricard), Germany (Oscherleben), Belgium (SPA) and Italy (Misano) next year there will be six rounds adding UK and Spain. With one round remaining we have had a very successful season lying sixth in the championship & fifth in our class out of over sixty teams. Even though we are one of the smaller teams on a small budget we have made a huge impact in the series and against the larger teams. Because of our work ethic and big effort we seem to be receiving a lot attention via social media and the racing world so we decided to push the team forward to the next step...

        h1 Trentside Racing Sponsorship

        hr

        p   ...to do this we first need to find some outside support via sponsorship. At the moment we have a Facebook & Instagram account called Trentside Racing & Endurance. Also we have two large vehicles constantly travelling around the UK and Europe which would be a perfect canvas for sponsors logoâ€™s as well as the normal space on bikes and clothing. Any kind of support would be very helpful and it would be a pleasure introducing sponsors to the exciting world of motorcycle endurance racing. Many thanks - Trentside Racing.

        h1 Trentside Racing History

        hr

        p   We are a family run team with racing experience from the '60s to the present day. The Godfather of the team - "Paul" - is an ex sidecar international and TT racer. Pete and Ervin have been running at the sharp end of solo racing modern & classic for over the last decade. Nick is the more casual 'just for fun' kind of racer. All is not possible without Bev and Jamie - "the wives" - of the team keeping an eye on the job. The team have had many amazing experiences ranging from racing at many top UK meetings, TT & Manx GP and classic endurance around European circuits.
